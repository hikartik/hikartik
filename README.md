ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hikartik!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on challenging web development projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full-stack web development. I have a good command of machine learning, and I have coded each and every algorithm from the very basics.

ðŸ’¼ I'm an engineering student pursuing a degree in computer science engineering from MNIT Jaipur. MNIT Jaipur is a college of national importance, and admission to the CSE branch requires securing a top 1 percentile in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).

ðŸš€ I have completed MERN full-stack development and am now exploring Next.js for development.
